- [X] Run `aditi init` to set up Vale configuration
- [X] Test `aditi journey` command with real files
- [X] Document any UX issues or confusing aspects
- [X] Verify all 27 rules work in practice

### 2. Fix Critical Issues Found During Testing (30 min)
- [X] Address any errors from end-to-end testing
- [X] Improve error messages for common failure cases
- [X] Ensure graceful handling of edge cases
- [X] Test interruption handling (Ctrl+C) during operations

### 3. Create Quick Start Guide (30 min)
- [X] Write docs/QUICKSTART.md with simple examples
- [X] Include common use cases and workflows
- [X] Add troubleshooting section for common issues
- [X] Create example AsciiDoc files that trigger each rule type

### 4. Prepare for User Testing (30 min)
- [X] Update README.md with clear installation instructions
- [X] Create a feedback collection template (GitHub issue template)
- [X] List known limitations and future enhancements
- [X] Prepare announcement blog post draft

## üîß Technical Debt (If Time Permits)
- [X] Remove duplicate dependencies in CLAUDE.md auto-generation
- [X] Add dry-run support to journey command
- [X] Improve progress indicators for long operations
- [X] Add --version flag that shows actual version from pyproject.toml

## üìù Documentation Tasks (If Time Permits)
- [ ] Create animated GIF demo of journey command
- [ ] Write comparison with other DITA migration tools
- [ ] Document rule customization process
- [ ] Create contributor guide

## üöÄ Next Session Priorities
1. User documentation polish
2. Create video walkthrough
3. Reach out to technical writing communities
4. Plan beta testing program
5. Set up user analytics/telemetry (with consent)

## Notes
- Focus on user experience validation - the code is solid but needs real-world testing
- Prioritize documentation that helps users get started quickly
- Collect specific examples where rules might need adjustment
- Consider creating a Discord/Slack community for users

Remember: The tool is technically complete. The next phase is about making it accessible and valuable to actual technical writers working with AsciiDoc to DITA migrations.
