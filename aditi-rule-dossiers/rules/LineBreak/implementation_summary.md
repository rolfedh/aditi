# LineBreak Rule Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the LineBreak rule as a fully deterministic fix for AsciiDoc hard line breaks that are not supported in DITA.

## Implementation Details

### Rule Classification
- **Fix Type**: FULLY_DETERMINISTIC (changed from NON_DETERMINISTIC)
- **Confidence Score**: 0.95

### Patterns Detected and Fixed
1. **Trailing space + plus sign** (`text +`)
   - Fix: Remove the ` +` at end of line
   - Example: `This is a line +` → `This is a line`

2. **Hardbreaks option attribute** (`:hardbreaks-option:`)
   - Fix: Remove entire line containing the attribute
   - Example: Line with `:hardbreaks-option:` → Empty line

3. **Options attribute with hardbreaks** (`[options="hardbreaks"]`, `[options='hardbreaks']`, `[options=hardbreaks]`)
   - Fix: Remove entire attribute line
   - Example: Line with `[options="hardbreaks"]` → Empty line

4. **Shorthand hardbreaks syntax** (`[%hardbreaks]`)
   - Fix: Remove entire attribute line
   - Example: Line with `[%hardbreaks]` → Empty line

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **Comments**: Line breaks within comments are ignored
2. **Code blocks**: Line breaks within code blocks (delimited by `----`, `....`, or ` ` ` `) are preserved
3. **Multiple variations**: Handles different quote styles in options attribute

### Files Created/Modified

#### Implementation Files
- `/src/aditi/rules/line_break.py` - Main rule implementation (updated from non-deterministic to fully deterministic)
- `/tests/unit/test_line_break_rule.py` - Comprehensive unit tests (10 test cases)
- `/tests/integration/test_line_break_integration.py` - Integration tests demonstrating full workflow

```

### Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: 10/10 passed
- **Integration Tests**: 2/2 passed
- **Code Coverage**: 89% for line_break.py

### Algorithm Summary
1. Check if violation is in a comment → Skip if true
2. Check if violation is in a code block → Skip if true
3. Identify the specific pattern type
4. Apply appropriate fix:
   - For trailing `+`: Remove suffix while preserving text
   - For attribute lines: Remove entire line
5. Validate fix before returning

### Performance Characteristics
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of lines in the file (for code block detection)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for fix generation
- **Confidence**: 95% - Very high confidence due to deterministic patterns

## Conclusion
The LineBreak rule has been successfully implemented as a fully deterministic fix, demonstrating the effectiveness of the AI-assisted rule development pipeline proposed in the design document. The implementation follows established patterns from EntityReference and ContentType rules while handling the specific requirements of line break removal.
