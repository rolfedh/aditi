// Examples of + in inline code that should NOT be flagged

== Regular Expressions
Use the command `grep '[0-9]+' file.txt` to find numbers.
The pattern `[a-zA-Z]+` matches one or more letters.
Run `sed 's/[[:space:]]+/,/g' data.csv` to convert spaces to commas.

== Mathematical Operations
Calculate with `echo $((5 + 3))` in bash.
The expression `x + y` adds two values.
Use ``counter++`` to increment.

== C++ Examples
The language +C+++ supports operator overloading.
Use `std::vector<int> operator+(const std::vector<int>& v)` for vector addition.

== Shell Line Continuation
This is different and should still be caught +
because it's an actual line break.

== More Code Examples
The regex `\w+` matches word characters.
Use `git log --oneline | head -10` to see recent commits.
Pattern ``[0-9]+`` in double backticks.

// But this line ends with a hard break +
// and should be fixed.
