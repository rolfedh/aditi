Metadata attribute that will help enable correct parsing and conversion to the appropriate DITA topic type.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE

////
Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
* file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
* ID: [id="doing-procedure-a_{context}"]
* Title: = Doing procedure A

 ID is a unique identifier that can be used to reference this module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.

The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID so you can include it multiple times in the same guide.

Be sure to include a line break between the title and the module introduction.
////

[id="doing-procedure-a_{context}"]
= Doing procedure A
////
Start the title of a procedure module with a gerund, such as Creating, Installing, or Deploying.
////

Write a short introductory paragraph that provides an overview of the module. The introduction should include what the module will help the user do and why it will be beneficial to the user. Include key words that relate to the module to maximize search engine optimization.

.Prerequisites
* A bulleted list of conditions that must be satisfied before the user starts the steps in this module.
* Prerequisites can be full sentences or sentence fragments; however, prerequisite list items must be parallel.
* Do not use imperative statements in the Prerequisites section.

.Procedure
. Make each step an instruction.
. Include one imperative sentence for each step, for example:
.. Do this thing and then select *Next*.
.. Do this other thing, and this other thing, and then select *Next*.
. Use an unnumbered bullet (*) if the procedure includes only one step.
+
NOTE: You can add text, tables, code examples, images, and other items to a step. However, these items must be connected to the step with a plus sign (+). Any items under the .Procedure heading and before one of the following approved headings that are not connected to the last step with a plus sign cannot be converted to DITA.

////
Only the following block titles can be reliably mapped to DITA:

* Prerequisites or Prerequisite
* Procedure
* Verification, Results, or Result
* Troubleshooting, Troubleshooting steps, or Troubleshooting step
* Next steps or Next step
* Additional resources

With the exception of Additional resources, these titles are only allowed in a procedure module. You can use each title exactly once and cannot use two different variants of the same title in the same module.

Additionally, you can use block titles for figures, tables, and example blocks.
////

.Verification
Delete this section if it does not apply to your module. Provide the user with verification methods for the procedure, such as expected output or commands that confirm success or failure.

* Provide an example of expected command output or a pop-up window that the user receives when the procedure is successful.
* List actions for the user to complete, such as entering a command, to determine the success or failure of the procedure.
* Make each step an instruction.
* Use an unnumbered bullet (*) if the verification includes only one step.

.Troubleshooting
Delete this section if it does not apply to your module. Provide the user with troubleshooting steps.

* Make each step an instruction.
* Use an unnumbered bullet (*) if the troubleshooting includes only one step.

.Next steps
* Delete this section if it does not apply to your module.
* Provide a bulleted list of links that contain instructions that might be useful to the user after they complete this procedure.
* Use an unnumbered bullet (*) if the list includes only one step.

NOTE: Do not use *Next steps* to provide a second list of instructions.

[role="_additional-resources"]
.Additional resources
////
Optional. Delete if not used.
Provide a bulleted list of links and display text relevant to the assembly. These links can include `link:` and `xref:` macros. Do not include additional text.
