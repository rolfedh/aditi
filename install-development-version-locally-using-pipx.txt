> help me run aditi against another repo on this machine. To do that, I need to make sure I get the latest changes from you. Let's say I cd to ~/quarkus, what 
  command do I run there to ensure I've got the latest changes we're making here in VS Code development environment?

● You need to install the development version of aditi from your local source code. From ~/quarkus, run:

  pip install -e ~/aditi

  This installs aditi in "editable" mode, so any changes you make in VS Code will immediately be available when running aditi commands in other directories.

  error: externally-managed-environment

  × This environment is externally managed
  ╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
      python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
      install.
      
      If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
      create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
      Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
      sure you have python3-full installed.
      
      If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
      it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
      virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.
      
      See /usr/share/doc/python3.12/README.venv for more information.

  note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking 
  your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
  hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
  rolfedh@my-HP-Z2-Mini-G3-Workstation:~/quarkus$

● Use pipx to install the development version:

  pipx install -e ~/aditi

  This will create an isolated environment for aditi and make it available system-wide. If you need to update it later after making changes, run:

  pipx reinstall aditi
