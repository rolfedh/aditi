4. **Success**: Your package will be available at https://pypi.org/project/aditi/

## Post-Publishing

After successful upload:

## Troubleshooting

- **401 Unauthorized**: Check your ~/.pypirc has the correct API token
- **Package exists**: The name might be taken - check https://pypi.org/project/aditi/
- **Invalid distribution**: The build might have issues - check the warnings above

Good luck with your first PyPI release! ðŸŽ‰
