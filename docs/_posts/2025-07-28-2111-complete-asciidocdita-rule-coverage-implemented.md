# Complete AsciiDocDITA Rule Coverage Implemented

ðŸŽ‰ **Major milestone achieved!** Aditi now supports **all 26 AsciiDocDITA rules** from the [official Vale style package](https://github.com/jhradilek/asciidoctor-dita-vale).

## What's New

We've implemented **18 new rule implementations** covering all remaining warning and suggestion levels:

- **Warning-level rules:** AdmonitionTitle, AuthorLine, BlockTitle, CrossReference, DiscreteHeading, EquationFormula, LineBreak, LinkAttribute, PageBreak, RelatedLinks, SidebarBlock, TableFooter, ThematicBreak
- **Suggestion-level rules:** TaskStep, TaskTitle, TaskDuplicate, ShortDescription, AttributeReference, ConditionalCode, IncludeDirective, TagDirective

## Strategic Approach

We implemented all rules using the **non-deterministic pattern** (flag/skip only) first, providing:

âœ… **Immediate value** - Complete issue visibility across all AsciiDocDITA rules  
âœ… **User choice** - Flag or skip any rule during the journey workflow  
âœ… **Future enhancement** - Deterministic fixes can be added based on priority and user feedback

## Impact

Users can now run `aditi journey` and get comprehensive analysis across **all 26 AsciiDocDITA rules**, making DITA migration preparation more thorough and systematic. The journey command processes rules in priority order: Error â†’ Warning â†’ Suggestion.

## Next Steps

Enhanced fix logic for high-priority rules based on user feedback and usage patterns.
