# About Aditi

Aditi (short for "asciidoc dita integration") is a complete reboot of asciidoc-dita-toolkit, designed from the ground up to help technical writers prepare AsciiDoc files for migration to DITA.

## Why Aditi?

The name Aditi is a Sanskrit word meaning "boundless" or "unlimited." In Hindu mythology, Aditi is a major goddess, often called the mother of the gods: Adityas. She represents infinity, the cosmos, and the boundless potential of the universe.

This name reflects our vision for the tool: unlimited potential for improving documentation workflows.

## Project Goals

- **Simplify Migration**: Make AsciiDoc to DITA migration as painless as possible
- **Automate Fixes**: Reduce manual work through intelligent automation
- **Interactive Experience**: Provide a conversational CLI that guides users
- **Modern Architecture**: Build on solid foundations with clean, maintainable code

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.7+
- **CLI Framework**: Click/Typer
- **Linting**: Vale with AsciiDocDITA ruleset (Docker-based)
- **Version Control**: Git with GitLab/GitHub integration
- **Distribution**: PyPI
