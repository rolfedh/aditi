  subject: "feat: Implement four non-deterministic error-level rules"
  body: "Add ExampleBlock, NestedSection, TaskExample, and TaskSection rules that
detect DITA compatibility issues requiring manual intervention:

- ExampleBlock: Flags example blocks outside main body of topic
- NestedSection: Flags nested sections (level 2+) that need file splitting
- TaskExample: Flags multiple examples in task topics (requires ContentType)
- TaskSection: Flags sections in task topics (requires ContentType)

All rules use Vale's AsciiDocDITA detection and insert comment flags with
format "// AsciiDocDITA <message>" for user review. Journey command presents
these with "Flag or skip? (F/s)" UI pattern as designed in mockup.

Tests: Added comprehensive unit tests covering all rule behaviors
Coverage: All 87 tests passing, rules auto-discovered by registry
