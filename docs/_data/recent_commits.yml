  subject: "feat: Enhance CLAUDE.md automation to recognize Phase 2 rule engine completion"
  body: "Updated the automation system to properly detect and document the major
Phase 2 achievement: implementation of 27 AsciiDocDITA rules using the
non-deterministic pattern.

Enhancements:
- Added Phase 2 detection logic in claude_md_updater.py
- Automatically counts implemented rules (27 detected)
- Recognizes core infrastructure: vale_parser.py, processor.py, scanner.py
- Documents non-deterministic pattern achievement
- Updates template to reflect Phase 2 completion
- Moves to Phase 3 as next focus

Phase 2 Achievements Now Documented:
âœ… Complete AsciiDocDITA rule engine with 27 implemented rules
âœ… Non-deterministic pattern implementation for consistent rule structure
âœ… Rule registry system for dynamic rule discovery and execution
âœ… ContentType rule (prerequisite for content-dependent rules)
âœ… EntityReference rule with deterministic fixes
âœ… Vale output parsing and violation processing
âœ… Document processing pipeline with rule application
âœ… File scanning and AsciiDoc document discovery

This ensures CLAUDE.md accurately reflects the massive rule implementation
work completed yesterday, providing proper context for future development.

  subject: "feat: Implement CLAUDE.md Hybrid Automation System"
  body: "Complete implementation of automated CLAUDE.md maintenance using multiple
trigger mechanisms for comprehensive documentation synchronization.

System Components:
- Template foundation (CLAUDE.template.md) with 5 auto-generated sections
- Smart updater script (512 lines) with intelligent project analysis
- GitHub Actions workflow for scheduled and event-driven updates
- Git hooks for immediate local updates on commits/pushes
- Comprehensive documentation and management tools

Auto-Generated Sections:
- Dependencies: Extracted from pyproject.toml and project detection
- Architecture: Live file structure with descriptive comments
- Commands: Discovered tools and development workflows
- Implementation Status: Phase completion based on file analysis
- Recent Development: 30-day commit analysis for themes and achievements

Automation Triggers:
- Immediate: Git hooks on commits affecting src/, tests/, pyproject.toml
- Scheduled: Weekly GitHub Actions updates (Sundays 6 AM UTC)
- Event-driven: Pushes to main branch with significant changes
- Manual: On-demand updates via python scripts/claude_md_updater.py

Benefits:
- CLAUDE.md stays synchronized with project evolution automatically
- 156 insertions, 113 deletions in first automated update
- Eliminates documentation drift while preserving human control
- Multiple trigger mechanisms ensure comprehensive coverage
