  subject: "feat: Implement complete AsciiDocDITA rule coverage with non-deterministic pattern"
  body: "- Implement all 26 AsciiDocDITA rules as non-deterministic (flag/skip pattern)
- Add 18 new rule implementations covering warning and suggestion levels
- Update RULE_PROCESSING_ORDER to include all rules by priority
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all new rules
- Ensure complete rule coverage for DITA migration preparation

New rules implemented:
Warning level: AdmonitionTitle, AuthorLine, BlockTitle, CrossReference,
DiscreteHeading, EquationFormula, LineBreak, LinkAttribute, PageBreak,
RelatedLinks, SidebarBlock, TableFooter, ThematicBreak

Suggestion level: TaskStep, TaskTitle, TaskDuplicate, ShortDescription,
AttributeReference, ConditionalCode, IncludeDirective, TagDirective

All rules follow non-deterministic pattern allowing users to flag or skip
issues. Future enhancement can add deterministic fix logic based on priority.

  subject: "feat: Add Vale command and enhance UI/UX improvements"
  body: "Major improvements to CLI usability and functionality:

- **New aditi vale command**: Direct access to raw Vale output with JSON/line/CLI formats and syntax highlighting
- **Enhanced journey UI**: Visual separators, bold/colored rule announcements, improved transitions between rules
- **Better user input**: Replace cumbersome arrow navigation with simple letter input for rule choices
- **Contextual prompts**: "Flag or skip?" for non-deterministic vs "Auto-fix, flag, or skip?" for others
- **Complete violation display**: Show all detected issues including unimplemented rules (ShortDescription, TaskStep)
- **ContentType improvements**: Ensure blank line after content type attributes for proper formatting
- **Vale path fixes**: Resolve container path issues causing "file does not exist" warnings
- **Clickable documentation links**: Rich markup for "Preparing Modules and Assemblies for DITA" link

Technical fixes:
- Fix symlink handling in both check and journey commands
- Convert absolute to relative paths for Vale container execution
- Improve spacing and formatting in analysis results display
- Add comprehensive error handling and validation
