  subject: "feat: Add backup functionality for .vale.ini files (fixes #3)"
  body: "- Create .vale.ini.original on first --force to preserve pre-Aditi config
- Create timestamped backups (.vale.ini.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS) on subsequent --force
- Keep only 5 most recent timestamped backups (original is never deleted)
- Add --list-backups option to show all available backups
- Add --restore-original option to restore from .vale.ini.original
- Add comprehensive test suite for backup functionality

This ensures users never lose their original Vale configuration when
using aditi init --force.

Fixes #3
