  subject: "fix: Standardize Jekyll front matter across all blog posts"
  body: "- Add layout: post to all posts for consistency
- Standardize front matter fields (layout, title, date, author, tags, summary)
- Remove problematic template with YYYY-MM-DD placeholder dates
- Create new post-template.md with proper date format
- Update _config.yml to exclude template from processing

This should resolve Jekyll build failures caused by invalid date parsing.
