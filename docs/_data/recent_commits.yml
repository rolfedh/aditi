  subject: "feat: Add comprehensive blog post validation tests"
  body: "Implements regression prevention for Jekyll front matter issues that
caused GitHub Pages deployment failures. The test suite validates:

- Front matter structure and required fields
- Filename conventions (YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-title.md)
- Date format consistency between filename and front matter
- Template file exclusions in Jekyll config
- Dangerous placeholder content detection

Includes:
- Standalone validation script (test_blog_post_validation.py)
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated validation
- Comprehensive test documentation
- PyYAML dependency for YAML parsing

Prevents the specific issues we encountered:
- Invalid date parsing from template files
- Inconsistent front matter formats
- Missing Jekyll exclusion rules
- Placeholder content in published posts
