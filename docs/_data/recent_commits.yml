  subject: "feat: EntityReference rule now respects AsciiDoc subs attributes"
  body: "- Check code block subs attribute to determine if entities should be processed
- Only fix entities in code blocks when subs includes "replacements"
- Respect subs="none", subs="attributes+", subs="normal" etc.
- Add comprehensive tests for different subs scenarios
- Add documentation explaining the behavior

This ensures that:
- Code examples preserve literal entities by default
- Users can opt-in to entity processing with subs="replacements"
- Aditi follows AsciiDoc's substitution model correctly

  subject: "feat: Implement single-source versioning"
  body: "- Version now maintained only in pyproject.toml
- __init__.py dynamically reads version from pyproject.toml
- Tests no longer hardcode version numbers
- Add release.py script for complete release automation
- Add bump-version.py for simple version updates
- Update scripts README with new tools

The release.py script automates the entire release process:
1. Bump version (major/minor/patch)
2. Run tests
3. Build and upload to PyPI
4. Create git commit and tag
5. Create GitHub release

This eliminates the need to update version in multiple places.

Fixes #18
