  subject: "Add drop shadow styling to all images in Just the Docs theme"
  body: "- Create custom SCSS file with drop shadow styles for images
- Add hover effect for enhanced interactivity

  subject: "Add blog posts comparing Jekyll themes and documenting Claude Code workflow"
  body: "- Move screenshots from docs/images/ to proper Jekyll assets structure
- Rename screenshots descriptively (minima-theme.png, just-the-docs-theme.png)
- Create theme comparison post with visual examples
- Document Claude Code's file organization workflow in meta post

The posts demonstrate both the visual differences between Jekyll themes
and how Claude Code interprets natural language requests for file operations.
