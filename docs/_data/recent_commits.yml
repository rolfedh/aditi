  subject: "fix: Remove typer[all] extra to avoid installation conflicts"
  body: "- Change dependency from typer[all] to typer to prevent conflicts
- Add troubleshooting docs for "Not a directory" installation error
- Provide multiple solutions: remove conflicting file or use pipx
- Update CLAUDE.md to reflect dependency change

The typer[all] extra was causing pip to fail when a 'typer' executable
already exists in ~/.local/bin/. Using the base typer package avoids
this conflict while maintaining all required functionality.

Fixes #17
