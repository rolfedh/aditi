  subject: "feat: Implement Phase 3 interactive journey and fix commands"
  body: "Implements complete interactive workflow for preparing AsciiDoc files for DITA migration:

- Add journey command with guided repository configuration and rule application
- Add fix command with interactive/non-interactive and dry-run modes
- Create directory scanner for finding .adoc files with .gitignore support
- Enhance configuration models with journey state tracking
- Add questionary dependency for interactive CLI prompts
- Update Phase 3 documentation with detailed implementation design
- Wire up both commands to main CLI with proper help text

The journey command provides progressive disclosure workflow:
1. Repository configuration with directory selection
2. Rule-by-rule processing (ContentType first as prerequisite)
3. Three action choices per rule: Auto-fix/Flag/Skip
4. Progress tracking and final report generation

The fix command supports targeted fixing with rule filtering,
confirmation prompts, and dry-run preview capabilities.
