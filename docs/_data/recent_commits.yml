  subject: "fix: Skip suggestion-level informational rules to prevent file modifications"
  body: "Resolves #26 by preventing AttributeReference, ConditionalCode,
IncludeDirective, and TagDirective rules from adding comment flags
to files. These suggestion-level rules are informational only and
should not modify source files.

Changes:
- Journey workflow now skips these 4 informational rules entirely
- Fix command excludes these rules from processing
- Maintains rule completion tracking for workflow continuity

- Backward compatibility with interactive mode

Resolves #26
