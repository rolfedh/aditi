  subject: "fix: Fix terminal crash in publish-to-pypi.sh when reading user input"
  body: "Resolves #7 by fixing the read command syntax that was causing terminal crashes:

- Replaced `read -p "prompt" -n 1 -r` with safer `echo -n` followed by `read -r`
- The `-n 1` option was causing terminal issues in some environments
- Added default values for all prompts using `REPLY=${REPLY:-N}`
- Added terminal detection to ensure script runs in interactive mode
- Added --non-interactive flag for CI/automation use cases
- Added --help flag with usage instructions

The script now handles user input more robustly and won't crash terminals.
It also provides better error messages and supports both interactive and
non-interactive workflows.

  subject: "fix: Auto-create configuration when running check/journey commands"
  body: "Resolves #5 by creating a seamless first-run experience:

- Added `create_default_config()` method in ConfigManager that:
  - Automatically scans for .adoc files in subdirectories
  - Identifies documentation root directories using DirectoryScanner
  - Adds found directories to allowed_paths automatically
  - Falls back to current directory if no .adoc files found

- Modified `check` command to:
  - Auto-create config when none exists
  - Show friendly progress messages during scanning
  - Add command-line paths to config automatically
  - Continue with check operation seamlessly

- Modified `journey` command to:
  - Auto-create config when none exists
  - Display found documentation directories
  - Continue with interactive workflow

This eliminates the workflow interruption where users had to run journey
first before check would work. Commands now "just work" out of the box
while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing configs.

  subject: "fix: Remove shell completion options from main help and add completion subcommand"
  body: "Resolves #2 by:
- Setting add_completion=False to remove --install-completion and --show-completion from main help
- Adding dedicated completion subcommand with --show and --install options
- Supporting bash, zsh, fish, and powershell shells with auto-detection
- Providing fallback manual setup instructions when completion generation isn't available
- Cross-platform shell completion installation with proper file locations

The main help output is now cleaner while preserving full completion functionality
in the appropriate completion subcommand.
