  subject: "fix: Improve CLAUDE.md updater with significance detection"
  body: "- Add logic to detect trivial vs significant changes
- Skip updates for commit count changes and file statistics
- Fix check mode to properly determine update necessity
- Prevent infinite loop commits from trivial updates

This resolves the issue where git hooks were creating
redundant commits for minor statistical updates.
