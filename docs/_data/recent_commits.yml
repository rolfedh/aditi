  subject: "feat: Improve directory selection UI for better user experience"
  body: "- Simplify language in prompts (no more 'auto-detected paths' jargon)
- Sort directories by file count (descending) to show impact immediately
- Pre-select all directories by default (users can deselect unwanted ones)
- Show total file count upfront before selection
- Add path autocomplete for custom directory entry
- Show available directories with file counts when entering custom paths
- Provide clear examples of valid path formats
- Accept multiple input formats (docs, ./docs, /docs, docs/)
- Improve error messages with 'Did you mean?' suggestions
- Warn when adding directories with no .adoc files
- Add scripts/create-issue.sh for creating GitHub issues via CLI

These changes address user feedback about confusing terminology and
difficult path entry, making the tool more intuitive for technical writers.
