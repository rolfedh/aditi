trigger mechanisms for comprehensive documentation synchronization.

- Template foundation (CLAUDE.template.md) with 5 auto-generated sections

- GitHub Actions workflow for scheduled and event-driven updates
- Git hooks for immediate local updates on commits/pushes
- Comprehensive documentation and management tools

Auto-Generated Sections:
- Dependencies: Extracted from pyproject.toml and project detection
- Architecture: Live file structure with descriptive comments
- Commands: Discovered tools and development workflows
- Implementation Status: Phase completion based on file analysis
- Recent Development: 30-day commit analysis for themes and achievements

Automation Triggers:
- Immediate: Git hooks on commits affecting src/, tests/, pyproject.toml
- Scheduled: Weekly GitHub Actions updates (Sundays 6 AM UTC)
- Event-driven: Pushes to main branch with significant changes
- Manual: On-demand updates via python scripts/claude_md_updater.py

Benefits:
- CLAUDE.md stays synchronized with project evolution automatically
- 156 insertions, 113 deletions in first automated update
- Eliminates documentation drift while preserving human control
- Multiple trigger mechanisms ensure comprehensive coverage
