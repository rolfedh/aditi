  subject: "fix: Fix terminal crash in publish-to-pypi.sh when reading user input"
  body: "Resolves #7 by fixing the read command syntax that was causing terminal crashes:

- Replaced `read -p "prompt" -n 1 -r` with safer `echo -n` followed by `read -r`
- The `-n 1` option was causing terminal issues in some environments
- Added default values for all prompts using `REPLY=${REPLY:-N}`
- Added terminal detection to ensure script runs in interactive mode
- Added --non-interactive flag for CI/automation use cases
- Added --help flag with usage instructions

The script now handles user input more robustly and won't crash terminals.
It also provides better error messages and supports both interactive and
non-interactive workflows.
