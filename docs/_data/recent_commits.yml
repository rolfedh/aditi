  subject: "feat: Add Vale command and enhance UI/UX improvements"
  body: "Major improvements to CLI usability and functionality:

- **New aditi vale command**: Direct access to raw Vale output with JSON/line/CLI formats and syntax highlighting
- **Enhanced journey UI**: Visual separators, bold/colored rule announcements, improved transitions between rules
- **Better user input**: Replace cumbersome arrow navigation with simple letter input for rule choices
- **Contextual prompts**: "Flag or skip?" for non-deterministic vs "Auto-fix, flag, or skip?" for others
- **Complete violation display**: Show all detected issues including unimplemented rules (ShortDescription, TaskStep)
- **ContentType improvements**: Ensure blank line after content type attributes for proper formatting
- **Vale path fixes**: Resolve container path issues causing "file does not exist" warnings
- **Clickable documentation links**: Rich markup for "Preparing Modules and Assemblies for DITA" link

Technical fixes:
- Fix symlink handling in both check and journey commands
- Convert absolute to relative paths for Vale container execution
- Improve spacing and formatting in analysis results display
- Add comprehensive error handling and validation

  author: "Rolfe Dlugy-Hegwer"
  subject: "feat: Implement four non-deterministic error-level rules"
  body: "Add ExampleBlock, NestedSection, TaskExample, and TaskSection rules that
detect DITA compatibility issues requiring manual intervention:

- ExampleBlock: Flags example blocks outside main body of topic
- NestedSection: Flags nested sections (level 2+) that need file splitting
- TaskExample: Flags multiple examples in task topics (requires ContentType)
- TaskSection: Flags sections in task topics (requires ContentType)

All rules use Vale's AsciiDocDITA detection and insert comment flags with
format "// AsciiDocDITA <message>" for user review. Journey command presents
these with "Flag or skip? (F/s)" UI pattern as designed in mockup.

Tests: Added comprehensive unit tests covering all rule behaviors
Coverage: All 87 tests passing, rules auto-discovered by registry
