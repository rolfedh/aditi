  subject: "feat: Implement robust CLAUDE.md updater with in-place updates"
  body: "Major improvements to the CLAUDE.md automation system:

## Eliminated Template File
- No more CLAUDE.template.md - updates CLAUDE.md directly
- Prevents synchronization issues and lost changes
- Preserves manually curated content (like phase completions)

## Robust Parsing & Error Handling
- Safe commit parsing with structured CommitInfo class
- Handles malformed git output gracefully
- No more "list index out of range" errors
- Comprehensive error reporting with tracebacks

## Intelligent Analysis
- Conventional commit parsing (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Breaking change detection (feat\!, fix\!)
- Commit categorization by scope and type
- Top changed files analysis
- Deterministic output with OrderedDict

## Content Validation
- Detects truncated words (e.g., "Implemented ation")
- Validates markdown syntax (unmatched code blocks)
- Checks for empty sections
- Prevents malformed content from being written

## Enhanced Features
- Dry-run mode with diff display
- Check mode for CI/CD integration
- Better dependency categorization
- More meaningful development focus metrics
- Cleaner, more readable output

## Comprehensive Testing
- 14 unit tests covering all major functionality
- Tests for edge cases and error conditions
- 100% test passing rate

This implementation addresses all the critical evaluation points
and provides a production-ready automation system for keeping
CLAUDE.md synchronized with project state.

  date: "July 30, 2025"
  author: "Rolfe Dlugy-Hegwer"
  subject: "fix: Resolve CLAUDE.md updater list index out of range error"
  body: "- Fix unsafe string splitting operations in _extract_achievements
- Add proper bounds checking for all split operations
- Add enhanced error reporting with traceback for debugging
- Update CLAUDE.template.md to include Phase 3 completion
- Regenerate CLAUDE.md with proper Phase 3 status

The error was caused by assuming split() operations would always
return the expected number of elements. Now checks array bounds
before accessing indices.
