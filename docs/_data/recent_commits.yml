  subject: "fix: Exclude blog post template from Jekyll processing"
  body: "The YYYY-MM-DD-hhmm-post-template.md file was causing Jekyll build failures
because it contains placeholder date format that Jekyll tried to parse as
a real datetime. Adding it to the exclude list in _config.yml fixes the
GitHub Pages deployment failures.
