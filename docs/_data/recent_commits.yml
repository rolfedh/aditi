  subject: "fix: resolve Vale container permission errors when running sync"
  body: "This commit fixes issue #14 where `aditi init --force` was failing with
a "permission denied" error when Vale tried to access the current
directory inside the container.

Changes made:
- Add SELinux context (:z) to volume mounts for proper permissions
- Set HOME environment variable to /docs inside container
- Create .vale/styles directory before running sync
- Add user ID mapping for file permission consistency
- Import os module for getuid/getgid functions

The error occurred because Vale was trying to access configuration
in the home directory (.) which wasn't accessible inside the container.
Setting HOME=/docs ensures Vale looks for config in the mounted volume.

Fixes #14

  subject: "feat: Add intermediate recheck step and fix accurate fix counting in journey workflow"
  body: "Addresses GitHub issue #12 by adding a recheck confirmation step before continuing to the next rule.
Also fixes misleading fix count reporting when violations cannot be automatically fixed.

Changes:
- Add "Recheck for issues before continuing to next rule?" prompt after applying fixes
- Implement recheck_rule_violations() to re-run Vale and show remaining issues
- Fix apply_auto_fixes() to accurately count and report only fixes that were actually applied
- Show helpful message when no fixes can be applied (e.g., violations in code blocks)
- Remove Rich link markup for better terminal compatibility

The recheck feature helps users verify that automatic fixes resolved issues before proceeding.
The fix counting improvement prevents confusion when violations exist but cannot be fixed.
