  date: "July 31, 2025"
  author: "Rolfe Dlugy-Hegwer"
  subject: "feat: Implement single-source versioning"
  body: "- Version now maintained only in pyproject.toml
- __init__.py dynamically reads version from pyproject.toml
- Tests no longer hardcode version numbers
- Add release.py script for complete release automation
- Add bump-version.py for simple version updates
- Update scripts README with new tools

The release.py script automates the entire release process:
1. Bump version (major/minor/patch)
2. Run tests
3. Build and upload to PyPI
4. Create git commit and tag
5. Create GitHub release

This eliminates the need to update version in multiple places.

Fixes #18

  subject: "fix: Remove typer[all] extra to avoid installation conflicts"
  body: "- Change dependency from typer[all] to typer to prevent conflicts
- Add troubleshooting docs for "Not a directory" installation error
- Provide multiple solutions: remove conflicting file or use pipx
- Update CLAUDE.md to reflect dependency change

The typer[all] extra was causing pip to fail when a 'typer' executable
already exists in ~/.local/bin/. Using the base typer package avoids
this conflict while maintaining all required functionality.
