  subject: "fix: resolve Vale container permission errors when running sync"
  body: "This commit fixes issue #14 where `aditi init --force` was failing with
a "permission denied" error when Vale tried to access the current
directory inside the container.

Changes made:
- Add SELinux context (:z) to volume mounts for proper permissions
- Set HOME environment variable to /docs inside container
- Create .vale/styles directory before running sync
- Add user ID mapping for file permission consistency
- Import os module for getuid/getgid functions

The error occurred because Vale was trying to access configuration
in the home directory (.) which wasn't accessible inside the container.
Setting HOME=/docs ensures Vale looks for config in the mounted volume.

Fixes #14
