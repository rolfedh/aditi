  author: "Rolfe Dlugy-Hegwer"
  subject: "Fix blog post chronological ordering and add timestamp automation"
  body: "This commit resolves blog post sorting issues by correcting filenames and
timestamps to reflect actual creation times, and adds automation to prevent
future timestamp mismatches.

## Blog Post Timestamp Fixes

### Corrected Chronological Order (July 27, 2025)
- 07:23 - I Finally Speak a Programming Language
- 08:32 - Setting Up GitHub Pages
- 08:45 - Minima vs Just the Docs
- 08:48 - Organizing Blog Assets with Claude
- 18:11 - Implementing Vale AsciiDocDITA Container Integration (Phase 0)
- 18:11 - Implementing Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Phase 1)

### Filename Updates
- Added HHMM time prefix to all filenames for chronological sorting
- Updated from 2025-01-27-* to 2025-07-27-HHMM-* format
- Example: 2025-07-27-0723-i-finally-speak-a-programming-language.md

### Timestamp Updates
- Updated all front matter with precise timestamps including timezone
- Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS -0400 (EDT)
- Matches actual file creation times from filesystem

## Automation and Prevention

### Blog Post Creation Script
- Added scripts/new-blog-post.sh for automated post creation
- Generates correct filename: YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-post-title.md
- Creates proper timestamp in front matter with current timezone
- Uses template as starting point with helpful instructions

### Updated Template
- Enhanced docs/_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-post-template.md with detailed guidelines
- Added filename and timestamp format instructions
- Included quick reference commands for manual creation
- Updated timezone to EDT (-0400)

### Documentation Updates
- Updated CLAUDE.md with automated and manual blog post creation guidelines
- Added scripts/README.md documenting utility scripts
- Clear examples and best practices for future posts

## Benefits
- Jekyll now sorts posts chronologically, not alphabetically by title
- Accurate development timeline visible on blog
- Eliminates human error in date/time formatting
- Future-proof automation for consistent blog post creation
- Proper timezone handling for all timestamps

- Comprehensive test suite with 94% success rate (34/36 tests)

### Package Structure
- Proper Python package with __init__.py and exports
- Entry point configuration for CLI commands
- Type checking support with py.typed marker
- Development dependencies and tool configurations

### CLI Functionality
- Working `aditi --help` with comprehensive command documentation
- Version display with `aditi --version`
- Functional `aditi init` command through proper CLI structure
- Placeholder commands for check, fix, and journey with helpful messages
- Verbose logging and error handling

### Testing Infrastructure
- Unit tests for config and git modules
- Integration tests for CLI functionality
- Shared fixtures for temporary directories and git repositories
- Proper mocking for external dependencies

### Documentation

- Comprehensive architecture documentation

## Phase 1 Success Criteria Met
âœ… `pip install -e .` - Package installs successfully
âœ… `aditi --help` - Shows all commands with descriptions
âœ… `aditi --version` - Displays version 0.1.0
âœ… `aditi init` - Initializes Vale configuration properly
âœ… Configuration load/save - Working with ~/aditi-data/config.json
âœ… Placeholder commands - All show expected messages

## Files Added/Modified
- pyproject.toml: Modern Python packaging configuration
- src/aditi/cli.py: Main CLI application with Typer
- src/aditi/config.py: Configuration management with Pydantic
- src/aditi/git.py: Git workflow guidance
- src/aditi/__init__.py: Package structure and exports
- tests/: Comprehensive test suite with fixtures
- docs/: Updated design documents and Phase 2 roadmap

Ready for Phase 2: Rule Engine Implementation
