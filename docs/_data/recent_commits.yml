  subject: "Now the directory selection UI will be clearer:"
  body: "  - ‚úì (green checkmark) for selected directories
  - ‚óã (gray circle) for unselected directories
  - ‚ùØ (arrow) to show which item is currently highlighted

  This makes it much clearer what's selected versus unselected.
  The styling provides visual contrast:
  - Selected items: Green checkmarks with white text
  - Unselected items: Gray circles
  - Current selection: White bold text with arrow indicator

  The UI should now be much more accessible and clear about which
  directories are selected for processing.
