  subject: "Fix Vale configuration file detection in container"
  body: "Fixed the "no config file found" error when running Vale in container by
using the VALE_CONFIG_PATH environment variable instead of --config flag.

Changes:
- Added VALE_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to point to /docs/.vale.ini
- Added :z SELinux context label to volume mount in run_vale_raw()
- Applied fix to both run_vale_raw() and run_vale_on_file() methods

The issue occurred because Vale looks for configuration during startup,
before processing command-line arguments. Using the VALE_CONFIG_PATH
environment variable ensures Vale finds the config file immediately.

Fixes: E100 [.vale.ini not found] Runtime error
