  subject: "feat: Implement complete AsciiDocDITA rule coverage with non-deterministic pattern"
  body: "- Implement all 26 AsciiDocDITA rules as non-deterministic (flag/skip pattern)
- Add 18 new rule implementations covering warning and suggestion levels
- Update RULE_PROCESSING_ORDER to include all rules by priority
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all new rules
- Ensure complete rule coverage for DITA migration preparation

New rules implemented:
Warning level: AdmonitionTitle, AuthorLine, BlockTitle, CrossReference,
DiscreteHeading, EquationFormula, LineBreak, LinkAttribute, PageBreak,
RelatedLinks, SidebarBlock, TableFooter, ThematicBreak

Suggestion level: TaskStep, TaskTitle, TaskDuplicate, ShortDescription,
AttributeReference, ConditionalCode, IncludeDirective, TagDirective

All rules follow non-deterministic pattern allowing users to flag or skip
issues. Future enhancement can add deterministic fix logic based on priority.
