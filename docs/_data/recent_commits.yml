  subject: "fix: Apply only specified rule when using --rule filter in fix and journey commands"
  body: "Previously, running "aditi fix --rule EntityReference" would apply ALL rules
instead of just the specified rule. This critical bug affected both the fix
and journey commands.

Changes:
- Added rule_filter parameter to processor.process_files() method
- Updated fix command to pass rule filter when processing files
- Updated journey command to pass rule filter when applying auto-fixes
- Added filtering logic in _process_file_violations to skip non-matching rules

This ensures that when users specify a specific rule with --rule, only that
rule's fixes or flags are applied to the files.
