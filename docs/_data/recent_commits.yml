  subject: "fix: Ensure temporary Vale config files are accessible in container"
  body: "- Add file synchronization after creating temporary config files
- Use os.fsync() to flush files to disk before container execution
- Add verification that temp config exists before running container
- Add enhanced debug logging for troubleshooting file access issues
- Include additional error context when 'does not exist' errors occur

This fixes issue #15 where Vale container couldn't find temporary
configuration files during single-rule execution.

  subject: "docs: Add container permissions best practices to CLAUDE.md"
  body: "Document lessons learned from fixing two container permission issues:
- SELinux context issues causing permission denied errors
- Path resolution issues with temporary config files

Add comprehensive guidance on:
- Proper volume mount configurations with SELinux contexts
- User ID mapping for consistent permissions
- Path conversion from absolute to relative for containers
- File synchronization before container access
- Common container permission errors and solutions

This documentation helps avoid similar container-related issues in the future.
