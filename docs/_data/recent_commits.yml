  subject: "fix: Fix 'list' object has no attribute 'is_file' error in aditi vale command"
  body: "The vale command was incorrectly calling run_vale() method which expects a single Path argument,
instead of run_vale_raw() which accepts a list of command-line arguments. This caused the error
when no paths were specified and the command tried to use configured allowed_paths.

Changes:
- Updated all calls from run_vale() to run_vale_raw() in vale_command functions
- Fixed typer.Argument default from None to default_factory=list
- Improved path handling for both string and Path objects in allowed_paths
