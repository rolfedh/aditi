# Phase 1: Next Steps for Aditi Implementation

## âœ… Phase 0 Completion Summary

You have successfully completed Phase 0! Here's what's been accomplished:

### Implemented Components
1. **Vale Container Integration** (`src/aditi/vale_container.py`)
   - Automatic Podman/Docker detection
   - Container lifecycle management
   - JSON output parsing
   - Comprehensive error handling

2. **Init Command** (`src/aditi/commands/init.py`)
   - User-friendly initialization with Rich progress bars
   - Automatic Vale image pulling
   - AsciiDocDITA style downloading via Vale's package system

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - `test_vale_integration.py` - Validates container functionality
   - `test_asciidocdita_rules.py` - Tests AsciiDocDITA rule application

4. **Documentation**
   - Container setup guide
   - Implementation documentation
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with current state

## ðŸš€ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure - What to Do Next

### Step 1: Create pyproject.toml
Start your next session with:
```
Create a pyproject.toml file for the Aditi project with:
- Modern Python packaging configuration
- Dependencies: typer, rich, pydantic for config
- Dev dependencies: pytest, mypy, ruff, black
- Entry points for the CLI commands
```

### Step 2: Implement Main CLI (cli.py)
```
Create src/aditi/cli.py that:
- Sets up the main Typer app
- Imports and registers the init command
- Adds placeholder commands for check, fix, and journey
- Configures logging
```

### Step 3: Create Package Structure
```
Create src/aditi/__init__.py to make it a proper package
Set up version info and package metadata
```

### Step 4: Configuration Manager (config.py)
```
Implement src/aditi/config.py with:
- Pydantic models for configuration schema
- Load/save functionality for ~/aditi-data/config.json
- Repository settings (root, branches, permissions)
- Session state management
```

### Step 5: Git Guidance Module (git.py)
```
Create src/aditi/git.py that:
- Provides functions to guide users through git operations
- Generates git command suggestions
- Helps with branch naming
- Assists with commit message formatting
```

### Step 6: Testing Setup
```
Set up the tests/ directory structure:
- tests/unit/ for unit tests
- tests/integration/ for integration tests
- Create pytest configuration
- Write tests for the new modules
```

## ðŸ“‹ Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Start with pyproject.toml** - This enables proper package installation and dependency management
2. **Create basic CLI structure** - Get `aditi --help` working
3. **Wire up existing init command** - Verify the CLI can call your existing code
4. **Add configuration management** - Essential for subsequent features
5. **Implement git guidance** - Needed for the full workflow
6. **Write tests** - Ensure everything works together

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Phase 1

1. **Test Incrementally**: After each component, run the CLI to ensure it works
2. **Use Type Hints**: Leverage Typer's type hint support for better CLI UX
3. **Keep It Simple**: Focus on getting the structure right before adding features
4. **Document as You Go**: Add docstrings to all functions and classes

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria for Phase 1

By the end of Phase 1, you should be able to:
- Run `pip install -e .` to install Aditi in development mode
- Execute `aditi --help` and see all commands
- Run `aditi init` through the proper CLI structure
- Have configuration load/save working
- See placeholder messages for unimplemented commands

## ðŸ“š Reference Implementation Pattern

When asking Claude to implement each component, use this pattern:

```
Implement [component] for the Aditi project following these requirements:
- [Specific requirements from the implementation plan]
- Use the existing ValeContainer class for Vale operations
- Follow the established patterns from Phase 0
- Include comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Add appropriate type hints and docstrings
- Write unit tests for the module
```

## ðŸ”„ After Phase 1

Once Phase 1 is complete, you'll be ready for:
- **Phase 2**: Rule Engine Implementation (parsing Vale output, applying fixes)
- **Phase 3**: CLI Experience (journey command, interactive workflows)
- **Phase 4**: Reporting and Distribution

Good luck with Phase 1! The foundation you've built in Phase 0 sets you up for success.
