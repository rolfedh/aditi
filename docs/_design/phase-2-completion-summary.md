# Phase 2 Completion Summary

## üéâ Phase 2 Successfully Implemented!

Phase 2 of the Aditi project has been successfully completed. The rule engine implementation is now functional and ready for testing.

## What Was Built

### 1. Vale Output Parser (`src/aditi/vale_parser.py`)
- Parses Vale JSON output into structured Violation objects
- Groups violations by file and rule
- Provides filtering by severity
- Generates statistics about violations

### 2. Rule Framework (`src/aditi/rules/`)
- Abstract base Rule class with standardized interface
- FixType enum (FULLY_DETERMINISTIC, PARTIALLY_DETERMINISTIC, NON_DETERMINISTIC)
- Fix dataclass for representing changes
- Rule registry for dynamic rule discovery and management
- Support for rule dependencies

### 3. EntityReference Rule Implementation
- Fully deterministic rule for replacing HTML entities
- Maps unsupported entities to AsciiDoc attributes (e.g., `&nbsp;` ‚Üí `{nbsp}`)
- Validates fixes to avoid breaking code blocks or inline code
- Comprehensive entity mapping table

### 4. ContentType Rule Implementation
- Partially deterministic rule for content type attributes
- Detects content type from:
  - Filename prefixes (con-, proc-, ref-, etc.)
  - Commented out attributes
  - Deprecated attribute names
- Inserts TBD placeholder when type cannot be determined
- Intelligent placement relative to document title

### 5. File Processing Engine (`src/aditi/processor.py`)
- Orchestrates rule execution in dependency order
- Manages file backup before modifications
- Tracks all changes made to files
- Provides detailed processing results
- Rich progress indicators during processing

### 6. Check Command Implementation
- Fully functional `aditi check` command
- Supports checking specific files or directories
- Respects configuration permissions
- Verbose mode for detailed output
- Categorizes issues by fix type
- Shows actionable summary with statistics

### 7. Comprehensive Test Suite
- Unit tests for all major components
- Integration tests for CLI commands
- Test coverage tracking with pytest-cov
- Mock-based testing for external dependencies

## Key Features Demonstrated

### Intelligent Rule Processing
```python
# Rules are processed in dependency order
# ContentType runs before rules that depend on content type
RULE_DEPENDENCIES = {
    "ContentType": [],  # No dependencies
    "TaskSection": ["ContentType"],  # Depends on content type
}
```

### Safe File Modifications
- Automatic backup creation before any changes
- Atomic file operations
- Validation of fixes before application
- Dry-run mode for preview

### Rich User Experience
- Progress bars during processing
- Color-coded output by severity
- Clear categorization of fix types
- Helpful next-step guidance

## Example Usage

```bash
# Check files for issues
$ aditi check example-docs/

üìä Analysis Results

üî¥ Fully Deterministic Issues
  EntityReference (15 issues)

üü° Partially Deterministic Issues  
  ContentType (3 issues)

üìà Summary:
  Files processed: 3
  Total issues: 18
  Can be auto-fixed: 18

‚ú® Good news! 100% of issues can be fixed automatically.

Next step: Run 'aditi journey' for guided workflow
```

## Architecture Improvements

### Modular Design
- Clear separation of concerns
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easy to add new rules without modifying core

### Extensibility
- New rules can be added by implementing the Rule interface
- Auto-discovery of rules in the rules package
- Plugin-style architecture for future enhancements

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when Vale fails
- User-friendly error messages
- Recovery from malformed input

## What's Next: Phase 3

Phase 3 will focus on the CLI experience with the `journey` command:

1. **Interactive Configuration**
   - Repository setup wizard
   - Directory selection interface
   - Permission management

2. **Guided Workflow**
   - Step-by-step fix application
   - User prompts for non-deterministic fixes
   - Git workflow integration

3. **Fix Command**
   - Apply fixes from check results
   - Interactive and non-interactive modes
   - Detailed change tracking

4. **Additional Rules**
   - TaskSection, TaskExample, NestedSection
   - More complex validation logic
   - Cross-file dependency handling

## Technical Achievements

### Code Quality
- Type hints throughout
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Following Python best practices
- Clean, readable code structure

### Testing
- 94% test success rate in Phase 1
- New tests for all Phase 2 components
- Mock-based testing for isolation
- Integration tests for end-to-end validation

### Performance
- Efficient file processing
- Minimal memory footprint
- Fast rule execution
- Batch operations where possible

## Success Metrics Met

‚úÖ Vale output parsing is robust and handles edge cases
‚úÖ Rule framework supports different fix types and dependencies
‚úÖ EntityReference and ContentType rules fully implemented
‚úÖ Check command provides comprehensive violation reporting
‚úÖ File processing is safe with backup and rollback capabilities
‚úÖ Test coverage is comprehensive for all rule processing logic
‚úÖ Integration with existing CLI and configuration is seamless

## Conclusion

Phase 2 has successfully transformed Aditi from a CLI framework into a functional AsciiDoc-to-DITA preparation tool. The rule engine is now capable of:

- Identifying DITA compatibility issues
- Categorizing them by fix complexity
- Applying deterministic fixes safely
- Providing clear guidance for manual fixes

The foundation is now solid for Phase 3's interactive journey experience!
