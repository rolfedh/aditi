FILENAME AND TIMESTAMP GUIDELINES:

1. FILENAME FORMAT: YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-post-title.md
   - Use current date and time when creating the file
   - Example: 2025-07-27-1423-implementing-new-feature.md (created at 2:23 PM)

2. TIMESTAMP FORMAT: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS -0400
   - Use exact same date/time as filename
   - Use 24-hour format (14:23 not 2:23 PM)
   - Use EDT timezone: -0400 (or EST: -0500 in winter)
   - Example: 2025-07-27 14:23:45 -0400

3. QUICK REFERENCE:
   Current date/time: Use `date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M'` for filename
   Current timestamp: Use `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z'` for front matter

# Your Blog Post Title Here

## Introduction

Start with a compelling hook that explains why readers should care about this topic. Set the context and outline what you'll cover in the post.

Are you frustrated that gen AI can't read your mind and can't tranlate the half-baked prompt you just blurted out into a perfect implementation? You're going to have to do more of the heavy lifting. Here's how to start with an idea and end up with a plan that gen AI implementation that is (mostly) right.

- blurt out your idea and ask questions.
- ask it to brainstorm options, choose options, provide specifics.
- ask it if it has any questions
- ask it to give you an MVP plan
- edit the plan
- ask it to give you a prototype
- edit the prototype


## Optimized Workflow: From Idea to Implementation

Working with Claude.ai effectively requires a structured approach. Here's the proven workflow that transforms vague ideas into implementable plans:

### Phase 1: Ideation & Exploration
1. **Brain dump your idea** - Share your raw, unfiltered concept
2. **Ask clarifying questions** - Let Claude help you refine the scope
3. **Brainstorm options** - Explore different approaches and trade-offs
4. **Get specific** - Define requirements, constraints, and success criteria

### Phase 2: Planning & Validation
1. **Request an MVP breakdown** - Ask for a minimum viable implementation
2. **Validate the approach** - Review technical decisions and dependencies
3. **Refine the plan** - Iterate based on your domain knowledge
4. **Confirm understanding** - Ensure Claude has captured all requirements

### Phase 3: Implementation & Iteration
1. **Start with a prototype** - Build the core functionality first
2. **Test and refine** - Validate each component before expanding
3. **Iterate based on feedback** - Use real results to guide next steps
4. **Document lessons learned** - Capture insights for future projects

### Subsection 1

Explain your approach, methodology, or key insights. Break down complex topics into digestible sections.

```python
# Include code examples when relevant
def example_function():
    """Demonstrate concepts with working code."""
    pass
```

### Subsection 2

Continue building your narrative with supporting details, data, or additional examples.

## Results and Impact

Share outcomes, metrics, or feedback that demonstrates the value of your solution.

## Lessons Learned

Reflect on what worked well and what could be improved. Be honest about challenges faced.

## Next Steps

Outline future work, upcoming features, or how readers can get involved.

## Conclusion

Summarize key takeaways and reinforce the main message of your post.
