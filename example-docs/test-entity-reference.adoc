= Test Document with Entity References

This document contains various entity references that need to be fixed.

== Introduction

This is a test&nbsp;document with non-breaking spaces.

We also have em{mdash};dashes and en{ndash};dashes.

Some {ldquo};quoted text{rdquo}; is here too.

== Code Examples

Here's some code:

----
// This &nbsp; should not be replaced
// ADITI-EntityReference: HTML character entity references are not supported in DITA.
String text = "Hello&nbsp;World";
----

// ADITI-EntityReference: HTML character entity references are not supported in DITA.
And inline code: `&nbsp;` should also not be replaced.
