Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
* file name: ref_my-reference-a.adoc
* ID: [id="my-reference-a_{context}"]
* Title: = My reference A

 ID is a unique identifier that can be used to reference this module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.

The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID so you can include it multiple times in the same guide.

Be sure to include a line break between the title and the module introduction.

In the title of a reference module, include nouns that are used in the body text. For example, "Keyboard shortcuts for ___" or "Command options for ___." This helps readers and search engines find the information quickly.

Write a short introductory paragraph that provides an overview of the module.

A reference module provides data that users might want to look up, but do not need to remember. It has a very strict structure, often in the form of a list or a table. A well-organized reference module enables users to scan it quickly to find the details they want.

AsciiDoc markup to consider for reference data:

* Use a consistent system for file names, IDs, and titles.
